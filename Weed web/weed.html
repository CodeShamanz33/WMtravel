    <p> This strain is called Dark Star. It has a strong aromatic flavor. I
        prefer smoking in a bong, but blunt is just
        as good.
        if you decide to use a bong, be sure to have your munchies and various
        snacks ready. however if your stuck in
        "Cali",
        traffic prepare for a smooth ride.</p>

    <p>
        This strain is called YodaOG. It has a Strong Dank but Aromatic smell. I
        also prefersmoking in a bong, but we
        all know it's going in a blunt.
        Again be sure to have some food set aside. You might not eat a lot but
        you will definately get the sleep you
        need. This is also another smooth strain to enjoy,
        responsibly in "Cali traffic".
